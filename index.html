                Early Dynastic Period of Egypt(c. 3000–2686 BCE)
              </h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Archaic or Early Dynastic Period of Egypt (also known as
                Thinite Period, from Thinis, the supposed hometown of its
                rulers) is the era immediately following the unification of
                Upper and Lower Egypt c. 3100 BC. It is generally taken to
                include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the end of
                the Naqada III archaeological period until about 2686 BC, or the
                beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the
                capital moved from Thinis to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled
                by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in
                the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such
                as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape
                during the Early Dynastic period.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Before the unification of Egypt, the land was settled with
                autonomous villages. With the early dynasties, and for much of
                Egypt's history thereafter, the country came to be known as the
                Two Lands. The pharaohs established a national administration
                and appointed royal governors. The buildings of the central
                government were typically open-air temples constructed of wood
                or sandstone. The earliest Egyptian hieroglyphs appear just
                before this period, though little is known of the spoken
                language they represent.

              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                In ancient Egyptian history, the Old Kingdom is the period
                spanning c. 2686–2181 BC. It is also known as the "Age of the
                Pyramids" or the "Age of the Pyramid Builders", as it
                encompasses the reigns of the great pyramid builders of the
                Fourth Dynasty— among them King Sneferu, who perfected the art
                of pyramid-building, and the kings Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure,
                who constructed the pyramids at Giza.[1] Egypt attained its
                first sustained peak of civilization during the Old Kingdom—the
                first of three so-called "Kingdom" periods (followed by the
                Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom) which mark the high points of
                civilization in the lower Nile Valley.

              <h3>First Intermediate Period of Egypt (c. 2181–2055 BCE)</h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The First Intermediate Period, often[according to whom?]
                described as a "dark age" in ancient Egyptian history, spanned
                approximately one hundred and twenty-five years, from c.
                2181–2055 BC, after the end of the Old Kingdom. It comprises the
                Seventh (although it is mostly considered spurious by
                Egyptologists), Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and part of the Eleventh
                Dynasties. The concept of a "First Intermediate Period" was
                coined in 1926 by Egyptologists Georg Steindorff and Henri
                Frankfort.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Very little monumental evidence survives from this period,
                especially from the beginning of the era. The First Intermediate
                Period was a dynamic time where rule of Egypt was roughly
                equally divided between two competing power bases. One of those
                bases was at Heracleopolis in Lower Egypt, a city just south of
                the Faiyum region. The other was at Thebes in Upper Egypt. It is
                believed that during this time temples were pillaged and
                violated, artwork was vandalized, and the statues of kings were
                broken or destroyed as a result of the postulated political
                chaos. These two kingdoms would eventually come into conflict,
                leading to the conquest of the north by the Theban kings and the
                reunification of Egypt under a single ruler, Mentuhotep II,
                during the second part of the Eleventh Dynasty. This event
                marked the beginning of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.

              <h3>Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2050-1710 BCE)</h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Middle Kingdom of Egypt (also known as The Period of
                Reunification) is the period in the history of ancient Egypt
                following a period of political division known as the First
                Intermediate Period. The Middle Kingdom lasted from
                approximately 2050 to 1710 BC, stretching from the reunification
                of Egypt under the reign of Mentuhotep II in the Eleventh
                Dynasty to the end of the Twelfth Dynasty. The kings of the
                Eleventh Dynasty ruled from Thebes and the kings of the Twelfth
                Dynasty ruled from el-Lisht.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The concept of the "Middle Kingdom" as one of three "golden
                ages" was coined in 1845 by German Egyptologist Baron von
                Bunsen, and its definition evolved significantly throughout the
                19th and 20th centuries. Some scholars also include the
                Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt wholly into this period, in which
                case the Middle Kingdom would end around 1650 BC, while others
                only include it until Merneferre Ay around 1700 BC, last king of
                this dynasty to be attested in both Upper and Lower Egypt.
                During the Middle Kingdom period, Osiris became the most
                important deity in popular religion. The Middle Kingdom was
                followed by the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt, another
                period of division that involved foreign invasions of the
                country by the Hyksos of West Asia.

                The Second Intermediate Period marks a period when Ancient Egypt
                fell into disarray for a second time, between the end of the
                Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom. The concept of

              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The New Kingdom, also referred to as the Egyptian Empire, is the
                period in ancient Egyptian history between the 16th century BC
                and the 11th century BC, covering the 18th, 19th, and 20th
                dynasties of Egypt. Radiocarbon dating places the exact
                beginning of the New Kingdom between 1570 BC and 1544 BC. The
                New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period and was
                succeeded by the Third Intermediate Period. It was Egypt's most
                prosperous time and marked the peak of its power.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The concept of a "New Kingdom" as one of three "golden ages" was
                coined in 1845 by German Egyptologist Baron von Bunsen, and its
                definition would evolve significantly throughout the 19th and
                20th centuries. The later part of this period, under the 19th
                and 20th Dynasties (1292–1069 BC), is also known as the
                Ramesside period. It is named after the eleven Pharaohs that
                took the name Ramesses, after Ramesses I, the founder of the
                19th Dynasty.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Possibly as a result of the foreign rule of the Hyksos during
                the Second Intermediate Period, the New Kingdom saw Egypt
                attempt to create a buffer between the Levant and Egypt proper,
                and during this time Egypt attained its greatest territorial
                extent. Similarly, in response to very successful 17th-century
                attacks during the Second Intermediate Period by the powerful
                Kingdom of Kush, the rulers of the New Kingdom felt compelled to
                expand far south into Nubia and to hold wide territories in the
                Near East. In the north, Egyptian armies fought Hittite armies
                for control of modern-day Syria.

              <h3>Third Intermediate Period of Egypt (c. 1069–664 BCE)</h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Third Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt began with the
                death of Pharaoh Ramesses XI in 1070 BC, which ended the New
                Kingdom, and was eventually followed by the Late Period. Various
                points are offered as the beginning for the latter era, though
                it is most often regarded as dating from the foundation of the
                Twenty-Sixth Dynasty by Psamtik I in 664 BC, following the
                expulsion of the Nubian Kushite rulers of the Twenty-fifth
                Dynasty by the Assyrians under King Assurbanipal. The concept of
                a "Third Intermediate Period" was coined in 1978 by British
                Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The period was one of decline and political instability,
                coinciding with the Late Bronze Age collapse of civilizations in

              <h3>Late Period of ancient Egypt (c. 664–332 BCE)</h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Late Period of ancient Egypt refers to the last flowering of
                native Egyptian rulers after the Third Intermediate Period in
                the 26th Saite Dynasty founded by Psamtik I, but includes the
                time of Achaemenid Persian rule over Egypt after the conquest by
                Cambyses II in 525 BC as well. The Late Period existed from 664
                BC until 332 BC, following a period of foreign rule by the
                Nubian 25th dynasty and beginning with a short period of
                Neo-Assyrian suzerainty, with Psamtik I initially ruling as
                their vassal. The period ended with the conquests of the Persian
                Empire by Alexander the Great and establishment of the Ptolemaic
                dynasty by his general Ptolemy I Soter, one of the Hellenistic
                diadochi from Macedon in northern Greece. With the Macedonian
                Greek conquest in the latter half of the 4th century BC, the age
                of Hellenistic Egypt began.

              <h3>Ptolemaic Kingdom (c. 305–30 BCE)</h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Ptolemaic Kingdom (/ˌtɒlɪˈmeɪ.ɪk/; Koinē Greek: Πτολεμαϊκὴ
                βασιλεία, romanized: Ptolemaïkḕ basileía) was a Hellenistic
                kingdom based in ancient Egypt. It was ruled by the Ptolemaic
                dynasty, which started with Ptolemy I Soter's accession after
                the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and which ended with
                the death of Cleopatra and the Roman conquest in 30 BC.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Ptolemaic Kingdom was founded in 305 BC by Ptolemy I Soter,
                a diadochus originally from Macedon in northern Greece who
                declared himself pharaoh of Egypt and created a powerful
                Macedonian Greek dynasty that ruled an area stretching from
                southern Syria to Cyrene and south to Nubia. Scholars also argue
                that the kingdom was founded in 304 BC because of different use
                of calendars: Ptolemy crowned himself in 304 BC on the ancient
                Egyptian calendar, but in 305 BC on the ancient Macedonian
                calendar; to resolve the issue, the year 305/4 was counted as
                the first year of Ptolemaic Kingdom in Demotic papyri.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Alexandria, a Greek polis founded by Alexander the Great, became
                the capital city and a major center of Greek culture and trade.
                To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, the
                Ptolemies named themselves as pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took
                on Egyptian traditions by marrying their siblings per the Osiris
                myth, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian
                style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.
                The Ptolemies were involved in foreign and civil wars that led
                to the decline of the kingdom and its final conquest by Rome.
                Their rivalry with the neighboring Seleucid Empire of West Asia
                led to a series of Syrian Wars in which both powers jockeyed for
                control of the Levant. Hellenistic culture continued to thrive
                in Egypt throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods until the
                Muslim conquest.

              <h3>The Roman province of Egypt (c. 30 BCE–619 AD)</h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Roman province of Egypt (Latin: Aegyptus, pronounced
                [ae̯ˈɡʏptʊs]; Hellenistic Greek: Αἴγυπτος, romanized: Aígyptos,
                pronounced [ɛ́ːɡyptos]) was established in 30 BC after Octavian
                (the future Roman emperor Augustus) defeated his rival Mark
                Antony, deposed Pharaoh Cleopatra, and annexed the Ptolemaic
                Kingdom to the Roman Empire. The province encompassed most of
                modern-day Egypt except for the Sinai Peninsula (which would
                later be conquered by Trajan). Aegyptus was bordered by the
                provinces of Crete and Cyrenaica to the west and Judea (later
                Arabia Petraea) to the East.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The province came to serve as a major producer of grain for the
                empire and had a highly developed urban economy. Aegyptus was by
                far the wealthiest Eastern Roman province, and by far the
                wealthiest Roman province outside of Italia. In Alexandria, its
                capital, it possessed the largest port, and the second largest
                city of the Roman Empire.

              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The population of Roman Egypt is unknown; estimates vary from 4
                to 8 million.

                empire (c. 629–641 AD)
              </h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Persian conquest of Egypt, beginning in AD 619 or 618, was
                one of the last Sassanid triumphs in the Roman-Persian Wars
                against Byzantium. From 619 - 628, they incorporated Egypt once
                again within their territories, the previous (much longer) time
                being under the Achaemenids. Khosrow II Parvêz had begun this
                war in retaliation for the assassination of Emperor Maurice
                (582–602) and had achieved a series of early successes,
                culminating in the conquests of Jerusalem (614) and Alexandria
                (619).
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                A Byzantine counteroffensive launched by Emperor Heraclius in
                the spring of 622 shifted the advantage, and the war was brought
                to an end by the fall of Khosrow on 25 February 628. The
                Egyptians had no love of the emperor in Constantinople and put
                up little resistance. Khosrow's son and successor, Kavadh II
                Šêrôe (Šêrôy), who reigned until September, concluded a peace
                treaty returning territories conquered by the Sassanids to the
                Eastern Roman Empire.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Persian conquest allowed Miaphysitism to resurface in the
                open in Egypt, and when imperial rule was restored by Emperor
                Heraclius in 629, the Miaphysites were persecuted and their
                patriarch expelled. Egypt was thus in a state of both religious
                and political alienation from the Empire when a new invader
                appeared.

              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Following the Islamic conquest in 639, Lower Egypt was ruled at
                first by governors acting in the name of the Rashidun Caliphs
                and then the Ummayad Caliphs in Damascus, but in 747 the
                Ummayads were overthrown. Throughout the Islamic rule, Askar was
                named the capital and housed the ruling administration. The
                conquest led to two separate provinces all under one ruler:
                Upper and Lower Egypt. These two very distinct regions would be
                heavily governed by the military and followed the demands handed
                down by the governor of Egypt and imposed by the heads of their
                communities.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Egypt was ruled by various dynasties from the start of Islamic
                control in 639 and the end of it in the early 16th century. The
                Umayyad period lasted from 658 until 750. Next came the Abbasid
                period which focused on taxes and centralizing power. In 868 the
                Tulunids, ruled by Ahmad ibn Tulun, expanded Egypt's territory
                into the Levant. He would rule until his death in 884. After
                years of turmoil under Ahmad ibn Tulun's successor, many
                citizens defected back to the Abbasids and in 904 they would
                reclaim power from the Tulunids. In 969 Egypt came under the
                control of the Western caliphate and the Fatimids. This dynasty
                would begin to fade after the death of their last caliph in
                1171.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                In 1174, Egypt came under the rule of Ayyubids. The Ayyubids
                ruled from Damascus, not the Fatimid city of Cairo. This dynasty
                fought against the Crusader States during the Fifth Crusade.
                Ayyubid caliph Najm al-Din recaptured Jerusalem in 1240. He
                introduced Mamluk forces into his army in order to hold off the
                crusaders. This decision would be one he regretted.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Ayyubids were overthrown by their bodyguards, known as the
                Mamluks in 1252. The Mamluks ruled under the suzerainty of
                Abbasid Caliphs until 1517, when Egypt became part of the
                Ottoman Empire as Eyālet-i Mıṣr province.

              <h3>Late Period of ancient Egypt (c. 1517–1914)</h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The Eyalet of Egypt operated as an administrative division of
                the Ottoman Empire from 1517 to 1867. It originated as a result
                of the conquest of Mamluk Egypt by the Ottomans in 1517,
                following the Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517) and the absorption
                of Syria into the Empire in 1516. The Ottomans administered
                Egypt as an eyalet of the their Empire (Ottoman Turkish: ایالت
                مصر‎‎ Eyālet-i Mıṣr) from 1517 until 1867, with an interruption
                during the French occupation of 1798 to 1801.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Egypt always proved a difficult province for the Ottoman Sultans
                to control, due in part to the continuing power and influence of
                the Mamluks, the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the
                country for centuries. As such, Egypt remained semi-autonomous
                under the Mamluks until Napoleon Bonaparte's French forces
                invaded in 1798. After Anglo-Turkish forces expelled the French
                in 1801, Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian military commander of
                the Ottoman army in Egypt, seized power in 1805.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an
                Ottoman province. Istanbul granted Egypt the status of an
                autonomous vassal state or Khedivate in 1867. Isma'il Pasha
                (Khedive from 1863 to 1879) and Tewfik Pasha (Khedive from 1879
                to 1892) governed Egypt as a quasi-independent state under
                Ottoman suzerainty until the British occupation of 1882.
                Nevertheless, the Khedivate of Egypt (1867–1914) remained a de
                jure Ottoman province until 5 November 1914, when it was
                declared a British protectorate in reaction to the Young Turks
                of the Ottoman Empire joining the First World War on the side of
                the Central Powers (October-November 1914).

              <h3>British occupation (1914–1953)</h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The history of Egypt under the British lasts from 1882, when it
                was occupied by British forces during the Anglo-Egyptian War,
                until 1956, when the last British forces withdrew in accordance
                with the Anglo-Egyptian agreement of 1954 after the Suez Crisis.
                The first period of British rule (1882–1914) is often called the
                "veiled protectorate". During this time the Khedivate of Egypt
                remained an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire, and the
                British occupation had no legal basis but constituted a de facto
                protectorate over the country. This state of affairs lasted
                until the Ottoman Empire joined the First World War on the side
                of the Central Powers in November 1914 and Britain unilaterally
                declared a protectorate over Egypt. The ruling khedive was
                deposed and his successor, Hussein Kamel, compelled to declare
                himself Sultan of Egypt independent of the Ottomans in December
                1914.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The formal protectorate over Egypt did not long outlast the war.
                It was brought to an end by the Unilateral Declaration of
                Egyptian Independence on 28 February 1922. Shortly afterwards,
                Sultan Fuad I declared himself King of Egypt, but the British
                occupation continued, in accordance with several reserve clauses
                in the declaration of independence. The situation was normalised
                in the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936, which granted Britain the
                right to station troops in Egypt for the defence of the Suez
                Canal, its link with the Indian Empire. Britain also continued
                to control the training of the Egyptian Army. During the Second
                World War (1939–45), Egypt came under attack from Italian Libya
                on account of the British presence there, although Egypt itself
                remained neutral until late in the war. After the war Egypt
                sought to modify the treaty, but it was abrogated in its
                entirety by an anti-British government in October 1951. After
                the 1952 coup d'état, the British agreed to withdraw their
                troops, and by June 1956 had done so. Britain went to war
                against Egypt over the Suez Canal in late 1956, but with
                insufficient international support was forced to back down.

              <h3>Republic of Egypt (1953–present)</h3>
              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                The history of the Arab Republic of Egypt spans the period of
                modern Egyptian history from the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 to
                the present day, which saw the toppling of the monarchy of Egypt
                and Sudan, the establishment of a presidential republic, and a
                period of profound economic, and political change in Egypt, and
                throughout the Arab world. The abolition of a monarchy and
                aristocracy viewed widely as sympathetic to Western interests,
                particularly since the ousting of Khedive Isma'il Pasha, over
                seven decades earlier, helped strengthen the authentically
                Egyptian character of the republic in the eyes of its
                supporters. From then until now Egypt has always been an
                independent country.

                Gamal Abdel Nasser ended monarchical rule and established a
                republic in Egypt, known as the Republic of Egypt, following the
                1952 Egyptian revolution. Egypt was ruled autocratically by
                three presidents over the following six decades: by Nasser from
                1954 until his death in 1970, by Anwar Sadat from 1971 until his
                assassination in 1981, and by Hosni Mubarak from 1981 until his
                resignation in the face of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

                the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, with Field Marshal
                Tantawi as its chairman, elections were held and the Islamist
                Mohamed Morsi became the first democratically elected head of
                state in the entire history of Egypt. In 2013, after millions of
                Egyptians in huge rallies and demonstrations demanding Morsi's
                resignation, the army announced the ousting of Morsi and
                preparations for a new election. Adly Mahmoud Mansour Served as

              <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify">
                Ancient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic
                beliefs and rituals that formed an integral part of ancient
                Egyptian society. It centered on the Egyptians' interactions
                with many deities believed to be present in, and in control of,
                the world. Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to
                the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered
                on the pharaohs, the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess divine
                powers by virtue of their positions. They acted as
                intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were
                obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so
                that they could maintain Ma'at, the order of the cosmos. The
                state dedicated enormous resources to religious rituals and to
                the construction of temples.

                Islam is the dominant religion in Egypt with around an estimated
                90% of the population. Almost the entirety of Egypt's Muslims
                are Sunnis, with a small minority of Shia and Ahmadi Muslims.
                The latter, however, are not recognized by Egypt. Islam has been
                recognized as the state religion since 1980. Since there has
                been no religious census, the actual percentage of Muslims is
                not known: the percentage of Christians are estimated to be
                between 8% to 12% according to sources cited in articles

                The Egyptians were one of the first major civilizations to
                codify design elements in art. The wall painting done in the
                service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules
                and meanings. Early Egyptian art is characterized by the absence
                of linear perspective, which results in a seemingly flat space.
                These artists tended to create images based on what they knew,
                and not as much on what they saw. Objects in these artworks
                generally do not decrease in size as they increase in distance
                and there is little shading to indicate depth. Sometimes,
                distance is indicated through the use of tiered space, where
                more distant objects are drawn higher above the nearby objects,
                but in the same scale and with no overlapping of forms. People
                and objects are almost always drawn in profile.

                The Akhmim wooden tablets, also known as the Cairo wooden
                tablet, are two wooden writing tablets from ancient Egypt. They
                each measure around 18 by 10 inches (460 mm × 250 mm) and are
                covered with plaster. The tablets are inscribed on both sides.
                The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the first tablet include a list
                of servants, which is followed by a mathematical text.[1] The
                text is dated to year 38 (it was at first thought to be from
                year 28) of an otherwise unnamed king's reign. The general
                dating to the early Egyptian Middle Kingdom combined with the
                high regnal year suggests that the tablets may date to the reign
                of the 12th dynasty pharaoh Senusret I, ca. 1950 BC.[2] The
                second tablet also lists several servants and contains further
                mathematical texts

                The civilization of ancient Egypt was indebted to the Nile River
                and its dependable seasonal flooding. The river's predictability
                and fertile soil allowed the Egyptians to build an empire on the
                basis of great agricultural wealth. Egyptians are credited as
                being one of the first groups of people to practice agriculture
                on a large scale. This was possible because of the ingenuity of
                the Egyptians as they developed basin irrigation. Their farming
                practices allowed them to grow staple food crops, especially
                grains such as wheat and barley, and industrial crops, such as
                flax and papyrus.

                Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their
                dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were
                constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool in the heat of
                the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which
                contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for
                baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered
                with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed
                mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and
                individual tables comprised the furniture.

                During the Egyptian conquest, the Pharaoh would divide his army
                into two parts, the North and the South. They would then be
                further divided into four more armies named after the Egyptian
                god's Ra, Amen, Ptah, Sutekh (of all the armies the Pharaoh
                would align himself with Amen). From there he would pick a
                commander in chief, generally princes of the royal house who
                would then pick captains to enforce orders given down the chain
                of command. During war times, the commander in chief was given
                the job of selecting their captains, who were usually
                lower-ranking princes of the royal house.

                Egypt has had a navy since Ancient Egyptian times. The Ancient
                Egyptian Navy was a vital part of the military of ancient Egypt,
                helping to transport troops along the Nile River and fighting
                many battles such as the Battle of the Delta against the Sea
                Peoples. The Ancient Egyptian Navy imported many of their ships
                from countries such as the Kingdom of Cyprus. Several Ancient
                Egyptian solar ships are still present today. In the early
                1800s, Egypt under Muhammad Ali Pasha developed a modern
                European-style army and navy.

                which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual

                devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and

                Egyptian hieroglyphs were the formal writing system used in
                Ancient Egypt. Hieroglyphs combined logographic, syllabic and
                alphabetic elements, with a total of some 1,000 distinct
                characters. Cursive hieroglyphs were used for religious
                literature on papyrus and wood. The later hieratic and demotic
                Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, as was
                the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician
                alphabet. Through the Phoenician alphabet's major child systems,
                the Greek and Aramaic scripts, the Egyptian hieroglyphic script
                is ancestral to the majority of scripts in modern use, most
                prominently the Latin and Cyrillic scripts (through Greek) and
                the Arabic script and Brahmic family of scripts (through
                Aramaic).

                The ancient Egyptians wrote works on papyrus as well as walls,
                tombs, pyramids, obelisks and more. Perhaps the best known
                example of ancient Jehiel literature is the Story of Sinuhe;
                other well-known works include the Westcar Papyrus and the Ebers
                papyrus, as well as the famous Book of the Dead. While most
                literature in ancient Egypt was so-called "Wisdom literature"
                (that is, literature meant for instruction rather than
                entertainment), there also existed myths, stories and
                biographies solely for entertainment purposes. The autobiography
                has been called the oldest form of Egyptian literature.

                Amongst all civilizations and nations, Egypt has always
                maintained a unique position. Historically, Egypt is universally
                acknowledged as the world's most ancient state with a unified
                societal entity within its current geographical borders.Through
                this area, there runs the River Nile starting from the Great
                Lakes in the heart of Africa, through northern Sudan where the
                Ethiopian tributaries collecting rainwater flows into its main
                course.Running past the cataract area south of Aswan, it calms
                down, flowing smoothly down to its mouth on the Mediterranean
                Sea.

                Asia, Africa, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Middle East,
                and the Nile Basin are all geographic entities in which Egypt is
                either part of or is on the periphery of. This geographic
                position makes Egypt a crossroads between two continents and
                several geopolitical regions.

                In terms of bodies of water, it is surrounded by the
                Mediterranean and the Red Sea, for which it ensures the junction
                through the Suez Canal. This connection links the two seas and
                is also the path that joins the Indian and Atlantic oceans. The
                giant Nile River also traverses the country, carrying water and
                alluvium, building links and relationships, and ensuring
                encounters between civilizations.
